# Calcolo-Numerico
This repository contains the final project and the workshop of the **Calcolo Numerico** course (AY 20/21) at the *University of Naples Federico II*.

## Final Project
The [Final-project](https://github.com/dBenf/Calcolo-Numerico/Final-project) concerns the linear approximation by **spline** of *Covid-19* data in Italy, and the prediction of the curve trend by **linear regression**.

## Workshop
The [Workshop](https://github.com/dBenf/Calcolo-Numerico/Workshop) concerns a discussion of *partial derivative equations*, in particular the **Shallow-Water Equations** for the prediction and treatment of marine climatic phenomena.
